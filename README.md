[00:48.09] Black lock like the pot and the kettle
[00:49.46] Wreck shop, a monotonous fellow
[00:51.02] Lick a shot for the niggas tryna stop the journey
[00:53.23] JID pull up on a opp like, "What's poppin' Kermie?"

[00:57.60] IVs, gurneys, shit bag, gone for eternity, hey
[01:20.60] 
[01:00.11] More the merrier, more to come murder me, hey
[01:02.34] Close the casket, common the courtesy, hey
[01:04.40] Headshots too personal for a burglary, ooh
[01:06.74] Red dots 'cause killers could close curtains me
[01:08.52] I done did wrong, someone send me up vertically
[01:10.57] Horizontally, read me a passage from Deuteronomy
[01:12.71] Anything you can do to conquer the demon inside of me
[01:14.83] Any meaning the truth and the father, the spirit guided me
[01:43.83] 
[01:17.12] I can bleed in the booth and leave a tooth as a souvenir
[01:19.13] For who was here, and if you hearing it
[01:20.41] You know the spirit is imperative, imperative, imperial
[01:22.84] Black man pyramid, the peer of men, jack man with the gat
[01:25.48] Scratching off the serial, sack man, get the pack
[01:27.70] Money in the envelope, pissing down the urinal
[01:50.70] 
[01:30.08] Ass man in the strip club, tell her bend it over

[01:42.61] Swervin', swervin', swervin'
[01:44.49] Skrrtin', skrrtin', skrrtin', servin', servin', servin'
[01:47.45] Everything I done, it comes full circle
[01:49.62] Workin', workin', workin', workin'
[02:06.62] 
[01:50.62] I-I-I'm swervin', swervin', swervin'

[02:00.08] Odd Toddler, murderer, Madara, moniker
[02:02.44] Zeltron slither in, python, right on
[02:04.64] Right on queue, right Sun Tzu
[02:06.09] Kill you, vehicle swerves on you
[02:22.09] 
[02:08.19] Serves you right, you lose sight like demolish
[02:10.96] Break it down, build it up then repolish
[02:12.94] Like toenails on Odell with shoe deals that never, ever go well
[02:15.81] Take no Ls, 'cause I am not Noel
[02:31.81] 
[02:17.53] Bitch, the name's Denzel
[02:19.16] The flames exhale, my pants on braille
[02:21.35] You feel it? Similar to fish in a skillet
[02:23.55] Hoоk and a line intertwined when I reel it like films
[02:50.05] 
[02:26.00] Movie groovy, jinkies, Scooby
[02:27.66] Very spooky, soul is black as Moolies
[02:29.91] Talk like Pootie, I spit fire loogies
[02:31.89] Comin' off the kufi with the blues, no Tookie
[02:54.39] 
[02:34.27] So many y'alls, I'm bored, there's too many yawns
[02:36.48] I got a lot of green, it's too many lawns
[02:38.27] I'm still hot 'til I set in the dawn
[02:39.62] Until a nigga rockin' Saint Laurent
[02:41.13] We go together like Harry and Ron
[02:42.97] Treat the microphone the same as a wand
[02:44.66] Magic maxi pad (ah, yeah)
[02:57.16] 
[02:46.04] Denzel lusts for blood, I grab the MAC
[02:48.06] Made you half a man but not a Sag'
[02:50.11] Flow is ugly, time to bust a sag
[02:52.46] Clint Eastwood, I killed the good and bad
[02:54.68] Oh my God, would you look at that? How to kill a ego
[02:57.66] JID and Zel, Scorpion to Sub-Zero
[03:14.16] 
[02:59.95] Swervin', swervin', swervin'
[03:01.53] Skrrtin', skrrtin', skrrtin', servin', servin', servin'
[03:04.54] Everything I done, it comes full circle
[03:06.60] Workin', workin', workin', workin'
[03:23.60] 
[03:07.88] I-I-I'm swervin', swervin', swervin'
[03:10.14] Skrrtin', skrrtin', skrrtin', servin', servin', servin'
[03:13.29] Everything I done, it comes full circle
[03:15.23] Workin', workin', workin', workin', workin'
